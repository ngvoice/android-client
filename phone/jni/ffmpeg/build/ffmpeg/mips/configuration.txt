/opt/android/android-ndk-r8e/toolchains/mipsel-linux-android-4.6/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/mipsel-linux-android-gcc is unable to create an executable file.
C compiler test failed.

If you think configure made a mistake, make sure you are using the latest
version from Git.  If the latest version fails, report the problem to the
ffmpeg-user@ffmpeg.org mailing list or IRC #ffmpeg on irc.freenode.net.
Include the log file "config.log" produced by configure as this will help
solving the problem.
